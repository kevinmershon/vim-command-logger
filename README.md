# Vim Command Logger

#### This plugin creates a running audit trail of specific normal mode commands.

This is my first Vim plugin. Its goal is to provide a running audit trail
of specific normal mode commands which are executed. The intended purpose is for
third-party software to consume this log and use it to associate Vim actions
with other collected information.
